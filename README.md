# bunburrow-graph
Draw a graph of all the bunstacks in Paquerette Down the Bunburrows

# Installation

This script depends on the Graphviz package. Refer to their documentation for installation instructions https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html.

The script itself does not need installing. Simply run it directly `python bungraph.py`. You can paste your own bunny list into `my_buns.txt` and the lines will highlight green.
